    "\n",
    "Traditional geospatial workflows involve:\n",
    "- Downloading entire datasets\n",
    "- Processing them on local machines\n",
    "- Managing complex software installations\n",
    "- Dealing with interoperability challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud-native geospatial changes this paradigm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data stays in place**: Access only what you need, when you need it\n",
    "- **Compute happens near the data**: Minimize data movement, run analyses in the cloud (like this binder notebook server!)\n",
    "- **Standards-based interfaces**: Interoperate with existing tools\n",
    "- **Scalable infrastructure**: Automatically scale up compute resources when you need them, turn them off when you don't\n",
    "\n",
    "eoAPI's components enable you to adopt cloud-native practices with relative ease. Tradiditional workflows are still possible with the eoAPI stack, though. For example, if your users still want to download files to their own disk they can use the STAC API to search for the items they need then use the download links for the assets in each item.\n",
