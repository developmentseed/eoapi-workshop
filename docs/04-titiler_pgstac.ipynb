    "# 4. The Raster API: titiler-pgstac\n",
    "\n",
    "titiler-pgstac is the crown jewel of an eoAPI deployment. You can use titiler-pgstac to serve infinitely customizable visualizations of the data in your catalog with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Tiling 101\n",
    "XYZ map tiles are the backbone of web mapping technology. Traditionally, the tile images are generated from the raw data and stored in cloud storage so they can be easily fetched by a map client in a web browser (or desktop GIS application). These tiles are called \"static\" tiles because they are generated once and cannot be adjusted unless you regenerate the tiles from the raw source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The static nature of pre-generated tiles is a problem for dynamic datasets like satellite imagery collections where there may be new data streaming in at all times. It is not efficient to be continually rebuilding static tiles for an entire collection when the data are constantly changing!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic tiling** provides a solution to this problem. Instead of pre-rendering all of the tile images for a dynamic dataset, dynamic tiling renders the images on-the-fly as they are requested by client applications! Dynamically rendered tile images will take longer to return to the client but, **if the raw data are stored in cloud-optimized data formats**, processing latency will be minimized and you gain the ability to request any visualization configuration (colormap, min/max, band math, expressions, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "[titiler](https://developmentseed.org/titiler/) is the state-of-the-art in dynamic tiling. It can take an XYZ tile request, use rasterio/GDAL to read the portion of a data required to render the tile image, then return it to the requester as a .png (or whatever format is requested).\n",
    "\n",
    "[titiler-pgstac](https://stac-utils.github.io/titiler-pgstac/latest/) extends the core titiler functionality by providing a query interface for a `pgstac` database, allowing users to request visualizations of entire collections or mosaics of items that are in their STAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the power of titiler-pgstac, consider the following examples:\n",
    "1. You can create an interactive map with the most recent Sentinel-2 images from your STAC collection in just a few lines of code\n",
    "2. You can create an interacive map with the most recent **cloud-free** images from any period of time in the archive with 10 lines of code\n",
    "3. You can view natural color and false color composites of the imagery with one small change\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do all of this with titiler-pgstac with a single copy of the raw data in cloud storage!\n",
    "\n",
