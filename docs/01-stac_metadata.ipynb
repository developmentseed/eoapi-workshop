Creating STAC items with `pystac` is a bit more ergonomic than specifying the structure by hand because you can get type hints on all of the possible fields and can take advantage of pre-defined constants (like `pystac.MediaType.COG`) instead of trying to remember the actual values. Plus, you will be forced to populate all of the required fields from the STAC spec which can help you avoid heartburn induced by invalid STAC items."
